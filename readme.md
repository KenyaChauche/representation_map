# Federal Representation Map
This is a repo to contain data gathering, handling, and datasets used for creating an interactive map allowing users to explore state demographics and demographics of their federal representatives. The interactive map will be a Tableau Public dashboard, which will be available on my Tableau Public profile and on my website. Project is a work in progress.

This repo will be updated with direct links to the dashboard and a more evocative readme when the visualization is shippable.
